So, funny story - I accidentally left an old HTTP reference in source code of the compiled release pointing to the Cargo.toml in this branch instead of main which is used to compare the version and check for a possible new one ([7301156](https://github.com/louis-e/arnis/commit/73011560a79e264feda64173bb5d57c8b8586326#diff-df01559d557323788141a9fe34a10ce2a524697b1d84a61bd24c8710e9d9ef3fR8)). Now, I’m stuck with this branch as a backup for the compiled release. Looks like we’re all living with it now! Enjoy the ride. License and Code of Conduct will stay the same for this branch.
